I'll suggest several header feature ideas that could enhance your reading list experience, organized by functionality:

1. **Content Organization & Filtering**
   - Show archived articles. Show recently deleted articles.

2. **Reading Stats & Progress**
   - where to show reading streak?
   - Reading streak counter ("5 day streak! ðŸ”¥")

3. **Quick Actions**
   - "Add new article" button with URL input

4. **Smart Features**
   - "Continue Reading" section for in-progress articles - gooooood
   - Reading time estimate based on your actual reading speed - yeah sounds fine, but not really needed
   - Auto-categorization of articles (auto-tagging, search with tags cloud)

1. **Social Features** ????? not suuure
   - Share reading list with friends
   - See what friends are reading
   - Collaborative reading lists
   - Article recommendations from network
