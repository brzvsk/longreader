### Core Mechanics

Not a rocket science, just same as Duolingo did it.

> 1. Reading Progress
>    - Create a clear path where each article (or even section) represents a step forward
>    - Track progress both within articles and across reading journey
>    - Visualize progress through engaging UI elements
>    - Allow readers to see their historical reading path
>
> 2. Step Rewards
>    - Immediate rewards after completing each article/section
>    - Mix of visual rewards (badges, animations) and functional rewards
>    - Progressive reward scaling based on content length/difficulty
>    - Special rewards for completing related content series
>
> 3. Streak System
>    - Track consecutive days of reading activity
>    - Allow "freezing" streaks to accommodate busy days
>    - Provide streak protection items as rewards
>    - Show streak calendar with visual indicators
>
> 4. Milestone Rewards
>    - Tiered milestone rewards at 5 (special), 10 (enhanced), 30 (major), and 100 (ultimate) days streak
>    - Each tier includes increasingly valuable perks

### 1. Progress & Mastery Hypotheses

> **H1: Visual Progress Mapping**
> 
> Hypothesis:
> - Readers who can see their reading progress represented visually (like a "knowledge tree" growing) are 30% more likely to complete long articles
> 
> Implementation: 
> - Reading progress tree that grows with each completed article
> - Visual territory map where each completed article "claims" new space
> - Progress bars that fill with micro-animations

**H2: Skill Leveling System**

Hypothesis: 
- Readers who can "level up" in specific knowledge domains will read 40% more content in those domains

Implementation:
- Domain expertise levels (e.g., "Tech Novice" → "Tech Enthusiast" → "Tech Expert")
- Reading speed progression system
- Comprehension depth scoring

### 2. Achievement & Collection Hypotheses

**H3: Strategic Milestone System**
- Hypothesis: Breaking long content into achievement-marked chunks will increase completion rates by 25%
- Implementation:
  - "Quick win" achievements early in the reading journey
  - Progressive challenge scaling
  - Special achievements for completing series of related articles

**H4: Collection Completion Drive**
- Hypothesis: Readers who start themed collections will have a 45% higher completion rate of long articles within that collection
- Implementation:
  - Topic-based collection challenges
  - Limited-time reading collections
  - "Complete the set" motivators

### 3. Social & Competition Hypotheses

**H5: Social Reading Dynamics**
- Hypothesis: Readers in reading groups will complete 50% more long-form content than solo readers
- Implementation:
  - Reading circles with shared goals
  - Group challenges and achievements
  - Social accountability features

**H6: Competitive Reading Elements**
- Hypothesis: Friendly competition features will increase reading time by 35% for competitive personalities
- Implementation:
  - Weekly reading leaderboards
  - Reading speed challenges
  - Knowledge domain competitions

### 4. Habit Formation Hypotheses

**H7: Streak Mechanics**
- Hypothesis: Daily reading streaks with increasing rewards will establish long-term reading habits in 60% of users
- Implementation:
  - Daily reading minimums (e.g., 15 minutes)
  - Streak protection items
  - Compound rewards for longer streaks

**H8: Time-Block Rewards**
- Hypothesis: Rewarding specific reading time blocks will increase reading during those periods by 40%
- Implementation:
  - "Early Bird Reader" bonus (6-9 AM)
  - "Lunch Break Scholar" rewards
  - Weekend reading challenges

### 5. Content Discovery Hypotheses

**H9: Exploration Rewards**
- Hypothesis: Rewarding diverse reading patterns will increase content discovery by 55%
- Implementation:
  - "Genre Explorer" achievements
  - Cross-domain reading challenges
  - Source diversity bonuses

**H10: Depth vs. Breadth Balance**
- Hypothesis: Balancing rewards between deep topic expertise and broad knowledge will increase overall engagement by 45%
- Implementation:
  - Specialist vs. Generalist paths
  - Combined achievement tracks
  - Balanced scoring system

### Measurement & Validation Plan

For each hypothesis, we should track:
1. Completion rates
2. Time spent reading
3. Return frequency
4. Social sharing metrics
5. User satisfaction scores

### A/B Testing Strategy

Proposed initial tests:
6. Compare completion rates with/without visual progress mapping
7. Test different reward frequencies
8. Evaluate social vs. solo reading patterns
9. Measure impact of streak mechanics
