Let me help you brainstorm ideas to improve the beginning of articles. Based on the codebase, I see you're working with articles in a frontend application. Here are several practical suggestions to enhance the article beginnings:

1. **Show metadata**
- Show estimated reading time !!!!!
- Display publication date and last update time
- Display key topics/tags ???
- Show author information with their photo and brief bio - great, if bio is available (possibly scrapable via perplexity now)
- Add a difficulty level indicator

2. **add cover photo**
- Include a custom cover image that represents the article's main theme - yes, if there's cover image
- Consider adding a subtle gradient or background pattern to make it stand out

3. **Add Article Preview/Summary**
- Add a "TL;DR" section for quick takeaways !!!!
  - TD;DR is clickable
  - if article has TL;DR, show it by default and add links to parts

4. **Recommendations**
- Show related articles

5. **Visual Enhancements**
- Use a larger, more engaging typography for the opening paragraph !!!!
    - you need to ask 'think wild' to make this happen )) like adding gradient to the text and appearing animation looks kinda nice
